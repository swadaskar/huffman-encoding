# huffman-encoding
The following is the flow of the program.
* This program takes characters and their frequencies and arranges it in a priority queue with lowest frequency having highest priority.
* Then it makes a huffman tree using this queue.
* Finally it produces variable length code for each character.

# Input
This program takes input
* number of characters
* characters and their frequencies spaced out

# Sample output
Enter the no of characters: 5<br />
Enter the characters and their frequencies: n 3<br />
e 3<br />
g 2<br />
i 2<br />
r 1<br />
char g code 00<br />
char r code 010<br />
char i code 011<br />
char n code 10<br />
char e code 11<br />
